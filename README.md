**Baseball Swing Probability Analysis**

**Overview**

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting swing probabilities for pitches in baseball games. The dataset comprises information from approximately 2,000,000 pitches over three seasons. The primary goal is to predict swing probabilities for pitches in the third season of the dataset, which lacks the description column indicating swing events.

**Repository Contents**

year1.csv: Dataset for the first season.

year2.csv: Dataset for the second season.

year3.csv: Original dataset for the third season without swing probabilities.

validation.csv: Dataset with appended swing probabilities for the third season.

swing_probability_analysis.py: Script used for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.

swing_probability_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, visualizations, and model evaluation.

writeup.pdf: Detailed methodology and assumptions.

swing_probabilities_plots.pdf: Visualizations of swing probabilities.

documentation.csv: Definitions of the columns in the dataset.


**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

**Usage**
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
Run the script swing_probability_analysis.py to preprocess the data and train the model.
Open swing_probability_analysis.ipynb to explore the analysis and visualizations.

**Methodology**

Detailed methodology, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation processes are described in writeup.pdf.

**Visualizations**

Swing probability visualizations can be found in swing_probabilities_plots.pdf.
